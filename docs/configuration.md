# Configuration

## Environment Variables

Set these in your `.env` file or pass directly to `docker run` / `docker-compose.yml`.

### Core

| Variable | Required | Default | Description |
|----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `ADMIN_USER` | Yes | `admin` | Initial admin username |
| `ADMIN_PASS` | Yes | — | Initial admin password. Must be set **before the first startup** — the admin account is created only once, when the data dir is empty. Changing it later is ignored (change the password via Settings → Users, or delete `data/users.json` and restart). If unset, **no account is created** and login is impossible. |
| `MUSIC_DIR` | No | `/music` | Music directory inside the container |
| `DATA_DIR` | No | `/app/data` | Data directory for JSON storage |
| `JWT_SECRET` | No | auto-generated | JWT signing secret (persistent file `/app/data/jwt_secret`) |

### Search

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `SEARCH_PROVIDER` | `deezer` | Primary search: `deezer`, `ytmusic`, or `spotify` |
| `SEARCH_FALLBACK` | — | Fallback provider if primary fails |
| `DEFAULT_FORMAT` | `flac` | Default download format: `flac` or `mp3` |
| `DEFAULT_METHOD` | `yt-dlp` | Default download method: `yt-dlp`, `slskd`, or `lidarr` |
| `MAX_CONCURRENT` | `10` | Maximum concurrent download jobs |
| `RECOMMENDATION_SOURCE` | `combined` | Recommendation engine: `lastfm`, `deezer`, `spotify`, or `combined` |

### Spotify

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID` | Spotify app Client ID |
| `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET` | Spotify app Client Secret |
| `SPOTIFY_REFRESH_TOKEN` | Global Spotify refresh token (per-user OAuth preferred) |

### Navidrome

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `NAVIDROME_URL` | `http://navidrome:4533` | Navidrome Subsonic API endpoint |
| `NAVIDROME_USER` | — | Navidrome **admin** username. Doubles as the service account: it provisions the per-user Navidrome accounts and is the fallback identity for system paths. |
| `NAVIDROME_PASSWORD` | — | Password for that admin account |

Each MusicSeeker user gets its **own** Navidrome account, provisioned automatically
on first use — the music library is shared, but playlists, likes, stars and play
counts are per-user. See [Per-user Navidrome accounts](architecture.md#per-user-navidrome-accounts).

### Soulseek (slskd)

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `SLSKD_URL` | `http://slskd:5030` | slskd REST API endpoint |
| `SLSKD_API_KEY` | — | slskd API key |
| `SLSKD_DOWNLOAD_DIR` | `{MUSIC_DIR}/.slskd-downloads` | Path **inside the MusicSeeker container** where completed slskd downloads are found (filesystem, not API — distinct from `SLSKD_URL`) |

### Lidarr

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `LIDARR_URL` | `http://lidarr:8686` | Lidarr API endpoint |
| `LIDARR_API_KEY` | — | Lidarr API key |
| `LIDARR_ROOT_FOLDER` | `{MUSIC_DIR}/_lidarr` | Root folder path as seen by Lidarr |

### GitHub

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `GITHUB_TOKEN` | — | Fine-grained PAT for promoting in-app feedback into GitHub issues. Required permissions on the target repo: **Issues: Read and write**, **Contents: Read and write**, **Metadata: Read**. Leave unset to disable promotion (reports are still collected locally). |
| `GITHUB_REPO` | — | Target repository for promoted issues, as `owner/name` |
| `GITHUB_SCREENSHOT_BRANCH` | `bug-screenshots` | Branch where screenshots are committed. Kept off the main branch so binaries never enter its history. |

**Rate limits & storage:**
- In-app feedback submissions are rate limited to **5 reports per 10 minutes per user**.
- Local storage is capped at **200 reports / 200 MB total** (JSON + screenshots combined), evicting oldest-first when limits are reached.

### Other

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `LASTFM_API_KEY` | — | Last.fm API key (for Discover tab) |
| `DLNA_SERVER_URL` | auto-detected | Server URL for DLNA metadata |
| `DLNA_RENDERER_URL` | — | Manual DLNA renderer description URL |
| `PODCAST_SYNC_HOURS` | `6` | Auto-sync interval for podcast subscriptions |
| `BPM_WORKERS` | `2` | Thread-pool size for BPM/key analysis. Each worker holds large native audio buffers — raising this raises peak memory. |
| `MALLOC_ARENA_MAX` | — (unset) | glibc arena cap. **Set to `2` in production** — see [Memory limits](architecture.md#memory-limits). |

## In-App Settings

These are configured from the Settings page (admin only) and stored in `/app/data/settings.json`:

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Music Search | Primary search provider (Deezer / YouTube Music / Spotify) |
| Search Fallback | Fallback provider if primary returns no results |
| Podcast Search | Podcast search provider (iTunes / Spotify) |
| Download Method | Default download method per format |
| Max Concurrent | Number of simultaneous downloads |
| Recommendation Source | Engine for recommendations (Combined / Last.fm / Deezer / Spotify) |
| Navidrome URL/User/Password | Library integration settings |
| slskd URL/API Key | Soulseek integration settings |

## Per-User Settings

Each user can configure:

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Spotify OAuth | Per-user Spotify authorization (Settings > Account & App) |
| Hide Spotify | Hide Spotify tab in Library from navigation |
| Allowed formats | MP3, FLAC (admin-configurable per user) |
| Allowed methods | yt-dlp, slskd, Lidarr (admin-configurable per user) |
| Storage quota | Max disk usage in GB, 0 = unlimited (admin-configurable) |

## Per-Device Settings

Each device (browser/app instance) is identified by a UUID stored in `localStorage` and sent as `X-Device-ID` header. Settings are configured in Settings > "This Device":

| Setting | Values | Description |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| Device Name | free text | Friendly name (e.g. "Phone", "Work PC", "Tablet") |
| Output Mode | `default` / `local` / `dlna_only` | Controls playback routing |
| DLNA Renderer URL | URL | Renderer for DLNA Only mode |
| Player | `classic` / `dj` | Playback engine (`ms_player_engine`) — see below |

**Player engine:** two engines ship side by side — `classic` (`player.js`) and `dj`
(`player_v3.js`, adds beat-matched EQ/filter transitions). The choice is per device and
switchable in two places: Settings, or the **Player** row at the top of the 🎛 Live DJ
Controls drawer in the full player. Switching flushes the queue on the outgoing engine
and reloads the page — the engine module is memoized and owns a different audio graph, so
a reload is required. The drawer is reachable in both engines (in `classic` it shows only
the Player row), so the switch works in both directions. Cross-module code must resolve
the engine through `getPlayerModule()` (`player_active.js`) instead of importing
`player.js` directly, or the dj engine is silently bypassed.

**Output modes:**
- **Default** — local browser playback with optional cast button
- **Local Only** — hides cast button, never sends to DLNA
- **DLNA Only** — auto-connects to configured renderer on play, no local audio

Each device has its own independent queue, play position, and DLNA cast session. View and manage all registered devices in Settings > "This Device" > "My Devices".
